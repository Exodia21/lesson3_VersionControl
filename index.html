            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Collaboration is key factor in any business success without it it’s just matter of time until the company starts failing.  There will be projects that require collaboration from others by either working simultaneously or at different times. For this reason many companies use a Version Control System also known as VCS. A VCS is a system that records changes of file or set of files over a period of time and still be able to recall earlier version at a later date. The VCS informs the current user working on the project file on several things: who modify the file, when the person modify it, what types of changes were made to the file, and combining changes to the same file. Aside from allowing different people to work on file at the same time it also prevent files to be overwritten. And though VCS was built for collaborative projects in mind it can be used for non- collaborative projects as well. The VCS is based on the repository, there are two different types of repository one for the server which known as the Remote Repository and one on a local computer, which is known as Local Repository.  </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are two types of Version Control System CVCS (Centralized Version System) and DVCS (Distributed Version Control System). Both types have the same goal in mind, but how they shares data is what makes them different. Out of the two DVCS is the more popular cause of its flexibility and far less drawbacks.  In the past the CVCS had been the standard for people because it provides many advantages on local VCSs. Among these advantages has been allowing people to know what other people are doing to certain extent.  It allows Administrators fine control of who can do what. The downside to CVCS is like any other Centralized base if that server for any reason is down, so is the CVCS preventing people from saving their work. Also if corruption occurs within the server the risk of losing everything is extremely high. DVCS however is very similar to Peer-to-Peer network if something were to happen to one of the servers any of the client repositories of DVCS can be copied as a back up to the server to restore it.  Ever clone that is provided to clients within the DVCS is actually a full backup of the data.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Getting GIT on your local machine can happen in two different ways: First by turning your local directory that is not yet under Version Control or you can clone a Git repository from somewhere else. In order to initialize a Git one must go to the project’s directory input the correct based of your operating system once done it will create a new subdirectory name “.git”.  This will provide you a Git repository skeleton that contains all the necessary repository files. As for cloning an existing Git repository the user will need to input the proper command. This will allow Git to receive a full copy of what that particular server has. The good thing about Git, it has number of different transfer protocols you can use in order to clone it. Once Git is on the server it will provide other possible options it can do along with providing the user pros and cons of each.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Once Git is installed you will need to follow certain commands in order for Git to operate effectively and smoothly.  With Git your working directory will be either in two different types of states: Tracked or Untracked.  Tracked are files that have been process through Git and Git is aware of. These Files can be unmodified, modified, or staged. Untracked are files that have not gone through Git system in order for that to happen one must know the commands. There are three basic commands: “git init”, which installs Git on your machine. The “git add” command will allow Git to start tracking the new file. The “git add” command does not only start the process of tracking new files, but also serves other multipurpose functions such as staging files and marking merge-conflicted files as resolved. The “git commit” command is where the file is saved and stored in the repository for it to be pulled again from the repository for future use. There are other commands within Git that allow  a person to: stage modified files, provide status of a file, ignore files, viewing your stage & unstaged changes, remove files, moving files, and commit changes to the file.</p>
